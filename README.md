## FAQ
- Why I cannot edit stations anymore?

The edit feature is disabled because of vandalism. I cannot change this. [More information here](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/) and [here](https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api/issues/39)

- Will Shortwave compatible with the Librem 5?

Yes! We use the awesome [libhandy](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy) library to make the interface adaptive.

- Which database does Shortwave use?

[radio-browser.info](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/). It's a community database. Everybody can add/edit information.
